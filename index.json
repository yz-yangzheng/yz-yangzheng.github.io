However, accurately estimating the contributions of FDI to green knowledge spillovers becomes challenging without distinguishing whether an FDI involves environmentally-friendly commercial activities, i.e., green FDI. Using a new dataset that provides comprehensive coverage and detailed information on FDI activities in China, this paper develops four new definitions of green FDI by text-mining business descriptions and tracking patenting activities of foreign-invested firms. I identify the impacts of knowledge stocks resulting from green FDI firms on domestic firms' green innovation using Chinese firm-level data, along with an instrumental variable based on the changes in China's FDI opening-up policy. The results show no impact of green FDI firms' knowledge stocks on domestic firms' green innovation when green FDI firms operate within the same industry as domestic firms. In contrast, I find that a 1% increase in knowledge stocks resulting from green FDI firms in downstream industries contributes to a roughly 0.732% increase in green patenting activities of domestic firms. This knowledge spillover effect from downstream green FDI is more pronounced on domestic high-quality green innovation. Further investigation into the factors influencing green FDI knowledge spillovers reveals that the location of green FDI firms, technological proximity between industries, and environmental regulation stringency of green FDI origins contribute to the varying strength of the knowledge spillovers from downstream green FDI.","tags":null,"title":"Knowledge Spillover from Green FDI: Evidence from Green Innovation in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Jing Dai","Dong Xu","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691539200,"objectID":"ec13403f565be76ded1979f4a8256e7a","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetsinnovspillover/","publishdate":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetsinnovspillover/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-carbon innovation is increasingly recognized as a significant solution to carbon neutrality. This paper explores whether and how regulated parent firms influence low-carbon innovation outputs in their unregulated subsidiaries. Leveraging China’s regional emission trading scheme (ETS) pilots as a quasi-natural experiment, we identify the causal effect of low-carbon innovation spillover effects from ETS-regulated parent firms to their unregulated subsidiaries. Using the matched difference-in-differences identification strategy, we found that unregulated subsidiaries affiliated with regulated parent firms appear to have a better low-carbon innovation performance in terms of patent counts and citations compared with those similar unregulated subsidiaries affiliated with unregulated parent firms during the pre-and-post ETS periods. Such innovation spillover effects of China’s ETS is contingent on parent firms’ financial slack, top management teams’ experience, low-carbon knowledge stock, and geographical and technological proximities between parent firms and subsidiaries. Our findings have survived robustness checks on measurement errors, confounding factors, and alternative model specifications. Our study provides insights into the decarbonization strategy of promoting innovation through corporate ownership networks and the factors that make such a strategy more effective. We discuss our contribution to the intersection of sustainability and public policy in operations management research and provide suggestions to practitioners and policymakers.","tags":null,"title":"Low-carbon Innovation Spillover Effects through Corporate Ownership Network: Evidence from Emission Trading Scheme in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Chunhua Wang","Zhenxuan Wang","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"27c2513d93c37b316efb5a00e8098f63","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetsleakage/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetsleakage/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper evaluates the carbon leakage of China’s regional pilots of emission trading system (ETS). Our analysis leverages firm-level tax records, ownership networks, and the quasiexperimental nature of the ETS pilots.

However, the extent to which clean technologies are generating private and social economic benefits remains poorly understood to date, due to a lack of suitable data sources. Using a unique dataset disaggregating commercial activities of global publicly listed firms based on a new green taxonomy, this paper shows the variation of green revenues during 2009-2016. We document a smooth increase in average green revenues over years. This increase is mainly driven by the expansion of revenues from green products but not the structure change between green and non-green revenues. We find that firms' green revenues are enhanced by not only their own clean innovation but clean technology spillovers from other neighbouring firms close in the technological and product market spaces. We also find that the growing maturity of clean technologies facilitates firms to obtain more green revenues, particularly for firms with more own clean technologies. Firms with larger sizes and higher technology capacities benefit more from their own and others' clean innovation. The new evidence on clean technology spillovers implies considerable social benefits of clean innovation and the need to provide policy support to encourage investments in clean technologies.","tags":null,"title":"Green Revenues, Clean Innovation and Technology Spillover: Evidence from Global Firm Level Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677196800,"objectID":"cac3de9c480b859754a3580cdab156bd","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","publishdate":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","section":"publication","summary":"Using China's regional carbon market pilots as a natural experiment, we examine the impacts of the emission trading system (ETS) on firms' innovation and competitiveness.

We find no evidence that the ETS harms firms' profitability and productivity, partly due to the beneficial effect of climate innovation. We demonstrate early climate innovators can gain competitive advantages after the ETS launch.

With low carbon prices and infrequent allowance trading, whether China’s ETS is an effective approach for climate mitigation has entered the center of the policy and research debate. Utilizing China’s regional ETS pilots as a quasi-natural experiment, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of ETS on firm carbon emissions and economic outcomes by means of a matched difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The empirical analysis is based on a unique panel dataset of firm tax records in the manufacturing and public utility sectors during 2009 to 2015. We show unambiguous evidence that the regional ETS pilots are effective in reducing firm emissions, leading to a 16.7% reduction in total emissions and a 9.7% reduction in emission intensity. Regulated firms achieve emission abatement through conserving energy consumption and switching to low-carbon fuels. The economic consequences of the ETS are mixed. On one hand, the ETS has a negative impact on employment and capital input; on the other hand, the ETS incentivizes regulated firms to improve productivity. In the aggregate, the ETS does not exhibit statistically significant effects on output and export. We also find that the ETS displays notable heterogeneity across pilots. Mass-based allowance allocation rules, higher carbon prices, and active allowance trading contribute to more pronounced effects in emission abatement.","tags":null,"title":"The Effectiveness of China’s Regional Carbon Market Pilots in Reducing Firm Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"2694af838b8bba71af4b83d86ccb241b","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/aea_pp_2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aea_pp_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"China has launched seven regional pilots of emission trading scheme (ETS) to limit its carbon emissions.
