Our analysis leverages firm-level tax records, ownership networks, and the quasiexperimental nature of the ETS pilots. We find that ETS-regulated firms shift production to their unregulated sister entities in the same ownership network, resulting in an 8.3% increase in carbon emissions from these unregulated partners. We also show that the leakage mainly occurs among low-emission firms, under the mass-based allocation rule, and in areas with low regulatory risks. Accounting for carbon leakage, the aggregate effect of China’s ETS pilots on firm emissions becomes statistically insignificant.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon Leakage within Firm Ownership Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Chunhua Wang","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"056a88987206159e9f222475146bed27","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/pnas_2021/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pnas_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"China has implemented an emission trading system (ETS) to reduce its ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining rapid economic growth. With low carbon prices and infrequent allowance trading, whether China’s ETS is an effective approach for climate mitigation has entered the center of the policy and research debate. Utilizing China’s regional ETS pilots as a quasi-natural experiment, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of ETS on firm carbon emissions and economic outcomes by means of a matched difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The empirical analysis is based on a unique panel dataset of firm tax records in the manufacturing and public utility sectors during 2009 to 2015. We show unambiguous evidence that the regional ETS pilots are effective in reducing firm emissions, leading to a 16.7% reduction in total emissions and a 9.7% reduction in emission intensity. Regulated firms achieve emission abatement through conserving energy consumption and switching to low-carbon fuels. The economic consequences of the ETS are mixed. On one hand, the ETS has a negative impact on employment and capital input; on the other hand, the ETS incentivizes regulated firms to improve productivity. In the aggregate, the ETS does not exhibit statistically significant effects on output and export. We also find that the ETS displays notable heterogeneity across pilots. Mass-based allowance allocation rules, higher carbon prices, and active allowance trading contribute to more pronounced effects in emission abatement.","tags":null,"title":"The Effectiveness of China’s Regional Carbon Market Pilots in Reducing Firm Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2694af838b8bba71af4b83d86ccb241b","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/aea_pp_2018/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aea_pp_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"China has launched seven regional pilots of emission trading scheme (ETS) to limit its carbon emissions. Taking advantage of the variations in the regional ETS pilots across regions and sectors and over time, we employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approach to evaluate the effect of ETS on low-carbon innovation at the firm level. Using patent application data of publicly-listed firms in China between 2003 and 2015, we find that the ETS pilots induced innovation in low-carbon technologies. The more active pilots—measured by carbon price and turnover rate of allowance trading—are associated with more intense low-carbon innovation.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon Pricing Induces Innovation: Evidence from China's Regional Carbon Market Pilots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Jing Dai","Dong Xu","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ec13403f565be76ded1979f4a8256e7a","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetsinnovspillover/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetsinnovspillover/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Clean Energy Innovation Spillover Effects in Corporate Ownership Network: Evidence from Emission Trading Scheme in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cac3de9c480b859754a3580cdab156bd","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","section":"publication","summary":"Using China's regional carbon market pilots as a natural experiment, we examine the impacts of the emission trading system (ETS) on firms' innovation and competitiveness. We show that the ETS directs innovation towards climate-friendly technologies; it increases the climate patent ratio by 2.1 percentage points, equivalent to a 20.5 percent increase in the total climate patent counts. We find no evidence that the ETS harms firms' profitability and productivity, partly due to the beneficial effect of climate innovation. We demonstrate early climate innovators can gain competitive advantages after the ETS launch. The climate patents accumulated before the ETS enable regulated firms to improve total factor productivity and financial performance.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon Price, Innovation, and Firm Competitiveness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Myra Mohnen","Misato Sato","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"90364253139e370cd06d1cb0c5107c0e","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/grtech/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grtech/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Economic Returns on Low-carbon Technology Diffusion: Evidence from Global Firm Level Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"35eaea7dc8b169cf218486cce0bbfd59","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/greenfdi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/greenfdi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Knowledge Spillover from Green FDI: Evidence from Green Innovation in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Te Lai","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ac1ae563a939ea5c7d8d06f640fb483d","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/iea_ctp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iea_ctp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Global Carbon Market and Industrial Decarbonization Innovation","type":"publication"}]
