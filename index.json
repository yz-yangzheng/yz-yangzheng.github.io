However, the contributions of FDI to green knowledge spillovers may not be estimated accurately if one does not differentiate whether an FDI involves environmentally-friendly commercial activities, i.e., green FDI. This paper develops four new definitions of green FDI by text-mining the business description and tracking patenting activities of foreign-invested firms. I identify the impacts of knowledge stocks resulting from green FDI firms on domestic firms' green innovation using Chinese firm-level data, together with an instrumental variable based on the changes in China's FDI opening-up policy. The results show no impact of green FDI firms' knowledge stocks on domestic green innovation when green FDI firms operate within the same industry as domestic firms. In contrast, I find that a 1% increase in knowledge stocks resulting from green FDI firms in downstream industries contributes to roughly 0.732% increase in green patents of domestic firms. Such knowledge spillover effects of downstream green FDI are more pronounced on domestic high-quality green innovation. I further investigate the factors affecting green FDI knowledge spillovers and find that the location of green FDI firms, technological proximity between industries, and environmental regulation stringency of green FDI origins can influence the strength of the knowledge spillovers from downstream green FDI.","tags":null,"title":"Knowledge Spillovers from Green FDI: Evidence from Green Innovation in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Myra Mohnen","Misato Sato","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680048000,"objectID":"b7d034470e7fc0ecc123adb42599a659","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/ftsegr/","publishdate":"2023-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ftsegr/","section":"publication","summary":"Innovation of clean technologies is critical to mitigating increasing environmental challenges, while it can generate revenues for the inventing firms and beyond through technology spillovers. However, the extent to which clean technologies are generating private and social economic benefits remains poorly understood to date, due to a lack of suitable data sources. Using a unique dataset disaggregating commercial activities of global publicly listed firms based on a new green taxonomy, this paper shows the variation of green revenues during 2009-2016. We document a smooth increase in average green revenues over years. This increase is mainly driven by the expansion of revenues from green products but not the structure change between green and non-green revenues. We find that firms' green revenues are enhanced by not only their own clean innovation but clean technology spillovers from other neighbouring firms close in the technological and product market spaces. We also find that the growing maturity of clean technologies facilitates firms to obtain more green revenues, particularly for firms with more own clean technologies. Firms with larger sizes and higher technology capacities benefit more from their own and others' clean innovation. The new evidence on clean technology spillovers implies considerable social benefits of clean innovation and the need to provide policy support to encourage investments in clean technologies.","tags":null,"title":"Green Revenues, Clean Innovation and Technology Spillover: Evidence from Global Firm Level Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677196800,"objectID":"cac3de9c480b859754a3580cdab156bd","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","publishdate":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetscompetitive/","section":"publication","summary":"Using China's regional carbon market pilots as a natural experiment, we examine the impacts of the emission trading system (ETS) on firms' innovation and competitiveness.

We find no evidence that the ETS harms firms' profitability and productivity, partly due to the beneficial effect of climate innovation.

This study suggests that an emission trading scheme (ETS) provides a boost to low carbon innovation within corporate ownership networks. Leveraging China’s regional ETS pilots as a quasi natural experiment, we identify the causal effect of low carbon innovation spillover from ETS regulated parent firms to their unregulated subsidiaries. Using the matched difference in differences identification strategy, we found that unregulated subsidiaries affili ated with regulated parent firms appear to have a better low carbon innovation performance in terms of patent counts and citations compared with those similar unregulated subsidiaries affiliated with unregulated parent firms during the pre and post ETS per iods. Such ETS induced innovation spillover is contingent on geographical and technological proximities between parent firms and subsidiaries, member experience in top management teams, and financial slack in parent firms. These findings survived against a rich set of robustness checks on measurement errors, confounding factors, and alternative model specification s Our study provides insights into decarbonization strategy of promoting innovation through corporate ownership network and the factors that make such strategy more effective. We discuss the implications for knowledge transfer and sustainable operations mana gement and provide suggestions to practitioners and policymakers.","tags":null,"title":"Low-carbon Innovation Spillover through Corporate Ownership Network: Evidence from Emission Trading Scheme in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Chunhua Wang","Zhenxuan Wang","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659139200,"objectID":"27c2513d93c37b316efb5a00e8098f63","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/chinaetsleakage/","publishdate":"2022-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chinaetsleakage/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper evaluates the carbon leakage of China’s regional emission trading scheme (ETS) pilots. By leveraging firms’ ownership networks, we examine whether the regionally fragmented ETS pilots lead to emissions and production reallocation from regulated firms to unregulated sibling firms utilizing the matched difference-indifferences (DID) approach. The data pertain to a unique panel of firmtax records and their ownership in the manufacturing and public utility sectors during the 2008-2015 period. Our findings demonstrate unambiguous evidence that China’s ETS leads to a 9 percent increase in carbon emissions of non-ETS firms in the same ownership network as sibling ETS firms. The emission leakage occurs during the announcement and trading phases. The mechanism analyses further reveal that the leakage is driven by regulated firms’ relocation of production activities, low-emission firms, only under the mass-based rule, and fewer regulatory risk areas. Finally, accounting for the effects of China’s ETS pilots on both regulated firms and their siblings, our estimated aggregate effect of carbon regulation on firm emissions is positive and statistically insignificant.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon Leakage within Firm Ownership Networks: Evidence from China’s Regional Carbon Market Pilots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Chunhua Wang","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639958400,"objectID":"056a88987206159e9f222475146bed27","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/pnas_2021/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pnas_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"China has implemented an emission trading system (ETS) to reduce its ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining rapid economic growth. With low carbon prices and infrequent allowance trading, whether China’s ETS is an effective approach for climate mitigation has entered the center of the policy and research debate. Utilizing China’s regional ETS pilots as a quasi-natural experiment, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of ETS on firm carbon emissions and economic outcomes by means of a matched difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The empirical analysis is based on a unique panel dataset of firm tax records in the manufacturing and public utility sectors during 2009 to 2015. We show unambiguous evidence that the regional ETS pilots are effective in reducing firm emissions, leading to a 16.7% reduction in total emissions and a 9.7% reduction in emission intensity. Regulated firms achieve emission abatement through conserving energy consumption and switching to low-carbon fuels. The economic consequences of the ETS are mixed. On one hand, the ETS has a negative impact on employment and capital input; on the other hand, the ETS incentivizes regulated firms to improve productivity. In the aggregate, the ETS does not exhibit statistically significant effects on output and export. We also find that the ETS displays notable heterogeneity across pilots. Mass-based allowance allocation rules, higher carbon prices, and active allowance trading contribute to more pronounced effects in emission abatement.","tags":null,"title":"The Effectiveness of China’s Regional Carbon Market Pilots in Reducing Firm Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingbo Cui","Junjie Zhang","Yang Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"2694af838b8bba71af4b83d86ccb241b","permalink":"https://yz-yangzheng.github.io/publication/aea_pp_2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aea_pp_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"China has launched seven regional pilots of emission trading scheme (ETS) to limit its carbon emissions.
